              DreamWithCode is a Community Based Organization(C.B.0) founded with the aim of reaching out to children, 
              especially those from underprivileged families, and teaching them how to write computer programs.
               The vision shared by the founders of the
                organization was to equip a generation with programming skills at an early age.
            </p>
  
  
            <p>
              Understanding computers and learning the basics of coding helps children to
               develop an appreciation of how things work. ... This is an important reason 
               that coding should be taught in schools, so children learn these skills while they are young.
               The ability to solve problems is a trait that is useful in life in general.

                            Programming helps children learn to problem-solve
                            The ability to solve problems is a trait that is useful in life in general. We all want our 
                            children to become excellent problem solvers so that they can overcome any adversity they face.

                            Computer programming gives kids a challenge and helps them develop resilience
                            When children learn to code, they develop the ability to bounce back after failure. 
                            They learn that failure isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and in fact, 
                            it can often be something positive because it serves as a learning opportunity.

                            Coding teaches children how to think.
                            Learning to code teaches children how to think. Computer programming isn’t just about teaching how 
                            to type lines of code. It is more about teaching children how to think differently.

                            A child expands their creativity when they learn how to code.
                            Coding is important to learn because computer programming teaches children 
                            to experiment and gives them the confidence to be creative.

                              When you look at how the world is developing, coding is an extremely useful skill to possess. 
                              There are an increasing number of businesses who rely on computer code, 
                              not just those in the technology sector.

                In our opinion, teaching kids code is something that can be done as early as preschool. In fact, 
                we have an entire post dedicated to ideas for getting preschoolers started with coding. You can read this here.

                Even kids who can’t read can learn to code with block-based coding. Check out these coding apps that can help kids as your as 4 or 5 learn to code.
